Dans Dynamic Blog is the capstone project I worked on with two colleague apprentices at the Software Guild. It is the culmination of what we learned while at the Guild.

The project objective was to create a blog/content management site for a customer, Dan (played adeptly by a Guild instructor). Our team asked our customer questions about initial requirements to determine adequate specifications to meet customer wants and needs. 

The team then designed and built the application using the design documents as reference. The application build was executed using agile prinicpals; specifically user stories and planned iterative sprints to implement those user stories.
