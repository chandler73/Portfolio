DVDLibrary is an example of an object oriented program that interfaces through the console. The program uses java to manage a library of DVDs. Through the console interface, users can add, remove, and edit dvds in the library.

This program focuses on using java to create objects, store those objects in an Array List, retrieve objects, edit objects, remove objects, and write files out to a text document for persistent storage.
